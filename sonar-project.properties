# Project identification
# The organization key must match your SonarCloud organization slug (usually lowercase).
# The project key must match the project you created in SonarCloud.
# Common format: <organization>_<repo-name> or a custom key you set in SonarCloud.
sonar.organization=mihaildobroslavski
sonar.projectKey=MishoMish_github-workflows-katas

# --- Sources (set to the Gradle Java project layout) ---
# Limit analysis to the Java sources under `app/` so Sonar focuses on the application code.
sonar.sources=app/src/main/java
sonar.tests=app/src/test/java
sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8

# --- Java binaries & libraries (Gradle output)
# These point Sonar to compiled classes and produced JARs. Ensure Gradle has built the project
# before running the scanner (e.g. `./gradlew build` or use the Gradle Sonar plugin).
sonar.java.binaries=app/build/classes/java/main
sonar.java.test.binaries=app/build/classes/java/test
sonar.java.libraries=app/build/libs/*.jar

# --- Exclusions ---
sonar.exclusions=**/node_modules/**,**/dist/**,**/build/**,**/*.test.js,**/*.spec.js

# --- Optional: test coverage (Jacoco/Gradle) ---
# If you use Jacoco with Gradle, point Sonar to the XML report path produced by the jacoco plugin.
# To generate: add `jacoco` to your Gradle build and run `./gradlew test jacocoTestReport`.
sonar.coverage.jacoco.xmlReportPaths=app/build/reports/jacoco/test/jacocoTestReport.xml

# Notes:
# - Running `./gradlew sonarqube` with the SonarQube Gradle plugin is usually simpler and more
#   reliable for Gradle projects. If using the standalone scanner, ensure the project is built
#   (classes and jacoco reports exist) before invoking Sonar.
